Open Data frameworks, datasets and front-end for elections in Northern Ireland

## about the project
The Elections NI Open Data project is a collaboration of people who wanted to produce datasets and visualisations of the 2016 Northern Ireland Assembly elections, led by ODI Belfast at NICVA and the NI Open Government Network.

## the data
To get the data, view the [Schema](https://github.com/NICVA/electionsni/blob/master/schema.md) and [browse](http://electionsni.org.s3-website-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data/) the directories.

These databases are made available under the Open Database Licence (ODbL). Any rights in individual contents of the database are licensed under the Database Contents License. You should attribute authorship to electionsni.org and the Electoral Office for Northern Ireland.

## the site
Find us at [electionsni.org](http://electionsni.org). We are visualising data and communicating it to the public at large.

The site uses a number of javascript libraries:
* [d3](https://d3js.org/)
* [leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/)
* [lodash](https://lodash.com/)

The website data is comprised of JSON files, which are generated directly from the database hosted on the site.

## contributing
We're keen to have others contribute to the project however they can. Open an issue, or contact us to take part, or even if you just have an idea that we should look at.

**We're also looking for observers at count centers to help us crowdsource the results live. Again, get in contact if you want to help.**
